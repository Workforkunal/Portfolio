Hello! My name is Kunal Singh.
I was learning Kotlin Jetpack Compose language in Android. I have a strong knowledge in Android development, with language such as Kotlin Jetpack Compose. My understanding of Android Studio and the Android SDK allows me to efficiently design, develop, test, and deploy high-quality applications.I have hands-on experience developing and maintaining mobile applications for the Android platform. I am familiar with the Android lifecycle, user interface components, and data persistence techniques. My ability to troubleshoot and debug allows for the rapid resolution of issues during development and post-release. I am committed to writing clean, maintainable code and conduct thorough testing to identify and address any potential issues.
